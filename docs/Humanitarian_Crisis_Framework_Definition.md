# Humanitarian Crisis Framework — Universal Ethical Blocks

**Copyright © Sanjiva Kyosan** — Kyosan Ethical AI System

## Comprehensive Definition

**Humanitarian Crisis Framework — Universal Ethical Blocks** is a structured ethical framework for humanitarian crisis response. It defines a small set of **universal ethical blocks**: core, non-negotiable principles that apply across crises, regions, and actors so that assistance stays lawful, accountable, and respectful of dignity even in chaos and political contestation.

- **“Humanitarian Crisis Framework”** = the overall approach to how assistance is designed, delivered, and governed in emergencies (conflict, displacement, famine, pandemic, etc.), including who decides, who delivers, and how consent and risk are handled.

- **“Universal Ethical Blocks”** = a fixed set of high-level norms that are always applied and not traded off for convenience or speed. They act as mandatory building blocks for any policy, protocol, or AI-assisted decision in this space.

In the Kyosan / gold-standard version, the framework is implemented through **three Universal Ethical Blocks**:

---

### 1. Universal Legal & Sovereignty Continuity

**State Consent & Legal Pathway Continuity**: Primary delivery will seek consent of the de-jure or internationally recognized government. In the absence of a functioning central authority, operations will default to the **Tripartite Approach** (UN agency + territorial state + observing/border state) as soon as a credible national interlocutor emerges. Until then, all cross-line or cross-border movements are explicitly framed as **time-limited emergency measures** under customary IHL (GC IV Arts. 23 & 59) and will automatically transition to fully consented modalities within 14 days of recognition of a new authority or conclusion of a new technical agreement.

### 2. Universal Protection Against Privacy-vs-Survival Dilemmas

**Protection from Coercive Consent**: No individual shall be excluded from life-saving assistance due to refusal to share personal data. Beneficiaries who exercise opt-out rights for manifests, biometrics, GPS tracking, or any surveillance-derived dataset will be automatically rerouted to alternative delivery channels (e.g., in-kind distributions via local partners, cash through hawala networks, air drops, or pre-positioned stocks) with a binding agency target of **≥98% of opt-out cases** still receiving equivalent assistance within **96 hours**. Psychosocial support messaging will explicitly communicate that **choosing privacy never equals choosing hunger or lack of medical care**.

### 3. Universal Last-Mile & Localization Safeguards

**Last-Mile & Localization Safeguards**: Final distribution inside contested or high-risk areas will be systematically handed over to credible local partners (national NGOs, municipality-level crisis committees, de-facto health directorates, or OCHA-administered country-based pooled fund partners) with established neutrality and acceptance. UN branding and foreign staff presence will be reduced or eliminated at the final distribution point whenever risk assessments indicate this lowers reprisal probability by **≥30%**, while impartiality and monitoring continue through third-party or remote mechanisms.

---

## Summary

**In one sentence:** The **Humanitarian Crisis Framework — Universal Ethical Blocks** is an ethical architecture for crisis response that obliges all operations to respect **state consent and legal continuity**, to **never force a choice between privacy and survival**, and to **prioritize last-mile delivery through trusted local actors** with reduced exposure where it saves lives—so that assistance remains lawful, accountable, and dignified across all contexts.

**Implementation:** In the Kyosan Ethical AI System, the pipeline (harm detection, instruction validation, integrity, wellbeing, optional ethical subsystems, and output safety filter) supports consistent application of these blocks; see `docs/INTEGRATION_STATUS_VERIFICATION.md` and `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`.
